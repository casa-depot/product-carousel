biggest challenge
testing components that render after making asynchronous api calls
two problems: you don't want to actually make the api call, and you need to wait until the component renders to test it.

The first problem I solved by mocking my http module. I tried third party packages like moxios and nock, but in then end I solved the problem by mocking the http module by hand.

The second problem was figuring out how to pause the testing until the component renders with the data from the api call. For that I used a package called async-wait-until.
